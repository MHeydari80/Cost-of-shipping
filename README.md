# Cost-of-shipping
A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in  pounds).  
c(w)=
3.5, if 0 < w <=1 
5.5, if 1 < w <=3 
8.5, if 3 < w <=10
10.5, if 10 < w <=20
The program prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and display the shipping cost. If the weight is greater than 20, displays a message “the  package cannot be shipped.”
